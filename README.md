# Pets-App
An inventory android application to store the details of various pets. 
1. New information about a pet can be added.
2. Existing information about a pet can be updated.
3. Existing information about a pet can be deleted.

It is a simple android application which I made just to get familiar with SQLite usages with Android and also to implement the CRUD operations efficiently using Cursor Loaders in Android rather than going by the naive approach.
